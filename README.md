Multipurpose IRC bot


TODO: 
    more flexible configuration:
        - IRC/network in one place
        - module to load chosen from command line
        - options for the module get default from file, can be modified dynamically by owner/admin

    mafia module:
        - implement actual mafiascum roles
    werewolf module:
        - implement Miller's Hollow + New Moon roles
        - implement other roles
    both:
        - improve stat keeping (SQLA maybe?)

    generic irc stuff:
        - op/halfop from owner/admin
        - kick/ban from admin
